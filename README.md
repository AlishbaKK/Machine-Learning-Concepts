# Machine Learning Concepts

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Concepts** repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of fundamental machine learning concepts, algorithms, and practical implementations. It is a valuable resource for students, educators, and practitioners who want to understand the core principles of machine learning and apply them in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each containing resources, code, and explanations for different machine learning topics. Here is an overview of the main sections:

- **Feature Scaling and Learning Rate**: This section covers the importance of feature scaling and how to choose an appropriate learning rate for training machine learning models.

- **Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**: Here you will find an explanation and implementation of gradient descent optimization for linear regression, a fundamental algorithm for fitting linear models to data.

- **Multiple Variable Linear Regression**: This folder includes materials on extending linear regression to multiple variables, allowing for the modeling of more complex relationships between features and targets.
